Millions of years ago, there were no domestic dogs. Believe it or not, today's domestic dogs are descended from a wild, wolfish ancestor. How did the snarling, man-eating wolf of millions of years ago become the loyal lapdog of today? There are two theories about how wolves evolved into dogs. One theory is that ancient people selected certain wolves to mate and thereby affected the traits that were passed down with the genes from the parents to the pups. Another, more recent theory is that the genes that made some wolves less shy (and therefore more easily domesticated) also triggered in wolves a whole series of changes that rapidly changed the wolf of the past to the tame creatures we call "man's best friend."

Scientists use roaches to help them study cancerous tumors because roaches grow tumors similar to those found in humans. Also, breeding them is easy because they thrive under almost any conditions.

                Early scientists believed that all dinosaurs, like most reptiles, laid and then immediately abandoned their eggs. The newly hatched young were left to take care of themselves. However, the recent discovery of a group of nests has challenged this belief. The nests, which contained fossilized baby dinosaurs that were not newborn, provided evidence that dinosaur parents actually cared for their young. For some time after birth, the babies would stay at their nest while the parents brought back plant matter for food. The young stayed at home until they were large enough to roam safely on their own.

            The Pros and Cons of Distant Education <br><br>
            How does it feel to attend classes without going to school and without being with your teachers and classmates in person? Distance education is not a new idea and practice. In the latter part of the nineteenth century, it was already established although it was initially laughed off. When radio and television were developed and invented, many people began to believe in the possibility of having the teacher and the learner in two different locations. In the 1900s, it started to become popular as a means of obtaining a degree, especially for students who could not afford to stay full-time in school. It also became a means of getting formal training in the basic education curriculum. Recently during the COVID pandemic, distance education became the sole means of learning at all levels, from pre-elementary to tertiary, although it has not been bereft of both advantages and disadvantages.<br>

            Throughout the years of its implementation, distance education has proven numerous advantages. With the great flexibility offered by the different distance learning programs, many people have obtained degrees without having to leave their places of work as they can accomplish their requirements any time of the day as long as they have an internet connection. They can access learning materials online even in the middle of the night. They can attend classes in the comfort of their living rooms, beds, kitchens, or gardens. It is also cost-effective, eliminating other expenses associated with commuting, renting a school dormitory, or getting meal plans. As online education provides e-learning materials, video conferencing, and online tutorials to deliver knowledge to the learners, they have brought so much convenience to the learners.<br>

            The Pros and Cons of Distant Education <br><br>
            Be that as it may, distance education is not bereft of disadvantages. Brick-and-mortar institutions and in-person classes provide opportunities for learners to meet and interact with others on a personal level. This is something that distance learning cannot give; although learners can interact with classmates through chat rooms, emails, and discussion boards, they can never match the experiences the learners get in face-to-face interactions. The chances of being distracted when attending online classes are quite great as well. Unless a learner is self-motivated and has a great sense of focus, their tendency will always be leaning toward forgetting and being unable to meet requirements on time. Last but not least of the disadvantages is the fact that technology can be very complicated. Aside from investing in the necessary equipment and devices to obtain a sufficient amount of learning, one needs to subscribe to huge bandwidth of internet connection. In case of software malfunctions and technical glitches, learning can be completely stifled, thereby developing too much dependence on technology.<br>

        The history of the Philippines dates from the earliest hominin activity in the archipelago at least 709,000 years ago. Homo luzonensis, a species of archaic humans, was present on the island of Luzon at least 67,000 years ago. The earliest known anatomically modern human was from Tabon Caves in Palawan dating about 47,000 years. Negrito groups were the first inhabitants to settle in the prehistoric Philippines. By around 3000 BC, seafaring Austronesians, who form the majority of the current population, migrated southward from Taiwan.

        During the Neolithic or New Stone Age, the established Philippine communities were influenced by Islamic, Indian, and Chinese cultures. Islam arrived from Arabia, while Indian Hindu-Buddhist religion, language, culture, literature, and philosophy arrived through expeditions from the South-East. Some communities were also assimilated into the Chinese in habits and thoughts. These villages traded with China, India, Japan, Thailand, Vietnam, and Indonesia.

        The first recorded visit by Europeans is Ferdinand Magellan's expedition which landed in Homonhon Island, Eastern Samar on March 17, 1521.

The Spanish colonial period in the Philippines began with the arrival of Miguel López de Legazpi's expedition on February 13, 1565. He established the first permanent settlement in Cebu. Much of the archipelago came under Spanish rule, creating the first unified political structure known as the Philippines.

        Spanish rule ended in 1898 with Spain's defeat in the Spanish–American War. The Philippines then became a territory of the United States. U.S. forces suppressed a revolution led by Emilio Aguinaldo. The United States established a government to rule the Philippines. Later on, the U.S. promised the Philippines independence. The Philippine Commonwealth was established in 1935, as a 10-year interim step prior to full independence. However, in 1942 during World War II, Japan occupied the Philippines. The U.S. military overpowered the Japanese in 1945. The Treaty of Manila in 1946 established the independent Philippine Republic.

        Reading a book and watching a movie of the same story have a number of similarities and differences. They are similar as they both tell a story and give details and information about the narrative. Reading books or watching movies gives the reader and the viewer the same feeling and emotions about the story. Both require reader to understand what is happening to get the story. Books and movies have their own importance and it completely depends on people whether they prefer reading books or watching movies. 
        <br><br>
        While reading books require readers to have a broad imagination and open their mind for thoughts and visions, movies give an image of the story to the viewers. Reading books requires dedication and time; on the other hand, watching movies can save time. While watching movies is easier, people still prefer reading books because they have more characters and suspense. Movie producers eliminate some characters and details about the story in order to squeeze everything into one to two hours. Also, watching movies provide superior picture about the story since it is visual and is within a short timeframe, so the audience can remember the story easier. Furthermore, you can do anything while watching movies. For instance, you can do your assignment while watching movies or cook food and watch movies. In contrast, you need to be fully focused on reading a book, or else you won’t understand what’s happening in the story. Reading books can not only enhance the readers’ vocabulary and creativity, but also increase their reading and writing skills unlike watching movies which only provides entertainment.

        Books and movies have their own importance, and it completely depends on people whether they prefer reading books or watching movies. Their reasons can be different on their preference for books or movies, but whatever the reason is, reading books and watching movies have the same purpose in their life. Both tell a story and give details and information, and people read books or watch movies to entertain and utilize their leisure.

        Drive Against Illiteracy<br>
        Illiteracy is the biggest curse in our social life. Without higher education, no person can succeed socially and economically. Every responsible citizen should then participate in the campaign against Illiteracy. Various organizations can play a good role in this regard. Government should actively promote education in rural and backward areas. Education centers should be established in different parts of the country and this responsibility should be taken directly by students and teachers.

        Child Labor
        <br><br>
        <br>There are many children in our country who are deprived of education and the normal joyous experiences of childhood. While upper-middle-class boys and girls attend school, they work in farms and plantations, in dangerous mines, on streets, and in factories. Others work as private child domestic workers in middle-class and upper-class households. Parents are very poor, so children are forced to take up all these occupations.
        <br>Government should come up with strict laws to solve this problem. Along with the law, the government should introduce some economic reforms which will bring down the poverty line to some extent. Apart from this, to solve this problem, illiteracy needs to be eliminated and the birth rate must be controlled.

While this is becoming a rampant problem, this can be resolved by keeping personal information secure, by keeping documents and important ID cards in a safe place, monitoring own bank accounts, by using different and strong passwords for each account, and others.

        One of the most serious issues facing the majority of large urban areas is traffic jams. The main reason for this is that there are too many private cars on the roads these days, and a viable solution is to introduce more park-and-ride schemes.
        <br<br>
        <br>The number of people owning cars is increasing year on year, with most families now having more than one car. Most people like the convenience of traveling at the time they want to rather than being restricted to public transport timetables, so they prefer to drive themselves around rather than taking the bus or train. This is despite the fact that they frequently have to sit in long traffic queues as they near the city center. 
        <br>A solution that is proving successful in many areas is park-and-ride schemes. This is where you park your car free on the outskirts of the city and take a bus for the final part of your journey. The fee you have to pay for the bus trip is usually very small, and this public transport system is generally very regular, running every ten minutes or so. 
        <br>To conclude, the major urban problem of traffic congestion caused by the excessive number of private cars on city roads can be partly alleviated by the introduction of park-and-ride systems on city fringes.

        Effective communication is one of the aspects in building a family where every member is happy and peaceful at home and has a good relationship with the rest of the house folks. Yet, one of the most common problems of many families today is poor or lack of communication with one another. Family members do not talk to one another as often as possible. Members disregard the points of view and perspectives of their loved ones. Unnecessary arguments always occur which resolves nothing, thus making the problems bigger. It may also include keeping secrets and holding grudges with each other. 
        <br>Poor or lack of proper communication may be caused by everyone's busy schedule. Another reason is not paying too much attention when someone is talking; sentiments are being ignored. This   may   lead   to   misunderstandings   and   conflict   within   family   members. When this prolongs or continues, the members become distant with the family. 
        <br>So, how can this problem within the family be resolved? Establishing a more open and honest communication is the key. First of all, parents should set the example; they should listen and be open when expressing their feeling and thoughts to the children. If parents are doing this, the children are likely to follow the same practice. It is also a good idea to take some conscious effort and ask a member of the family if something seems wrong or troubling him or her. It may be true that everyone is having a busy schedule, but it is important to make time to talk with loved ones in trying times and inconveniences. Spending some quality time is another strategy; it is very important, for this can make very significant circumstances in one another’s individual lives emerge or come into view. Even when everything seems all right, asking questions like “How was your day?”, “Where have you been?”, “Are you okay?”, or “You can tell me your problem” is just a simple way to keep in touch and connected between and among the members. It may not be proven effective in the beginning, but in the long run, everybody else in the family will certainly realize its importance and will soon become more open and more understanding of one another.

It may be true that everyone is having a busy schedule, but it is important to make time to talk with loved ones in trying times and inconveniences. Spending some quality time is another strategy; it is very important, for this can make very significant circumstances in one another’s individual lives emerge or come into view. Even when everything seems all right, asking questions like “How was your day?”, “Where have you been?”, “Are you okay?”, or “You can tell me your problem” is just a simple way to keep in touch and connected between and among the members. It may not be proven effective in the beginning, but in the long run, everybody else in the family will certainly realize its importance and will soon become more open and more understanding of one another.

        Deforestation is one of the major environmental problems in the Philippines for a number of reasons. First, it has a negative impact on the environment. Deforestation can cause climate change, desertification, soil erosion, fewer crops, flooding, and increased greenhouse gases in the atmosphere. Additionally, deforestation negatively impacts indigenous people who often rely on forests for their livelihoods. Finally, deforestation contributes to poverty and hunger as it decreases the amount of land available for food production. In sum, deforestation is a major problem in the Philippines that must be addressed urgently.
        <br>What can be done to stop deforestation in the Philippines? First, it is important to raise awareness about the issue and its negative impacts. Second, laws and regulations against illegal logging and slash-and-burn farming practices need to be enforced more stringently. Third, alternative livelihoods for people who rely on forests for their income need to be developed. Finally, large-scale reforestation projects should be implemented to help restore lost forests.

                <sup>1</sup> Cell-cultured meat has been the subject of suspicion from organizations working to protect human health. <sup>2</sup> Some members of the general public are squeamish about cell-cultured meat. <sup>3</sup> Public opinion surveys have found that consumers hesitate to accept cell-cultured meat as a viable food option.
                <br><sup>4</sup> Caution isn’t necessarily a bad thing, but these critiques of cell-cultured meat are just thinly disguised neophobia. <sup>5</sup> Cell-cultured meat indeed comes from labs, not farms. <sup>6</sup> But what these critics fail to realize is that there’s nothing “natural” about the vast majority of the meat already eaten in the U.S. <sup>7</sup> Ninety-nine percent (99%) of animals raised for food live in factory farms. <sup>8</sup> On these farms, livestock is given doses of antibiotics regularly as a pre-emptive measure against illnesses. <sup>9</sup> Then there’s the fact that these animals eat an abnormal diet. <sup>10</sup> For example, instead of grass, cows are fed corn in feedlots, where they are fattened up before being sent to slaughter. <sup>11</sup> Even the animals themselves are drastically different from what our grandparents ate growing up: <sup>12</sup> the chickens, cows, pigs and even the fish we eat today are the product of intense genetic engineering. <sup>13</sup> Turkeys and chickens nowadays can no longer mate on their own, relying on artificial insemination to exist.   
                <br><sup>14</sup> Cell-cultured meat also faces criticism from some animal rights activists. Cell cultivation requires starter cells taken from actual animals. <sup>15</sup> Because of this, they emphasize that cell-cultured meat isn’t completely cruelty-free. <sup>16</sup> There’s truth to this. <sup>17</sup> Fetal bovine serum (FBS), extracted from unborn cow fetuses after the mother is slaughtered is used by many companies at the forefront of cell-cultured meat experimentation. <sup>18</sup> For the chicken, cells are extracted from the muscle and fertilized eggs of actual chickens.
                <br><sup>19</sup> The cell-cultured meat industry that currently uses FBS is still vastly kinder to animals than traditional livestock production and slaughter. <sup>20</sup> While FBS is harvested from slaughtered animals, extraction from the muscle or a fertilized egg is analogous to a biopsy done on humans

            <h3>Don't be so quick to dismiss lab-grown meat</h3><br>\r
            <p>\r
                Brian Kateman<br><br>\r
                <sup>1</sup> Cell-cultured meat has been the subject of suspicion from organizations working to protect human health. <sup>2</sup> Some members of the general public are squeamish about cell-cultured meat. <sup>3</sup> Public opinion surveys have found that consumers hesitate to accept cell-cultured meat as a viable food option.\r
                <br><sup>4</sup> Caution isn’t necessarily a bad thing, but these critiques of cell-cultured meat are just thinly disguised neophobia. <sup>5</sup> Cell-cultured meat indeed comes from labs, not farms. <sup>6</sup> But what these critics fail to realize is that there’s nothing “natural” about the vast majority of the meat already eaten in the U.S. <sup>7</sup> Ninety-nine percent (99%) of animals raised for food live in factory farms. <sup>8</sup> On these farms, livestock is given doses of antibiotics regularly as a pre-emptive measure against illnesses. <sup>9</sup> Then there’s the fact that these animals eat an abnormal diet. <sup>10</sup> For example, instead of grass, cows are fed corn in feedlots, where they are fattened up before being sent to slaughter. <sup>11</sup> Even the animals themselves are drastically different from what our grandparents ate growing up: <sup>12</sup> the chickens, cows, pigs and even the fish we eat today are the product of intense genetic engineering. <sup>13</sup> Turkeys and chickens nowadays can no longer mate on their own, relying on artificial insemination to exist.   \r
                <br><sup>14</sup> Cell-cultured meat also faces criticism from some animal rights activists. Cell cultivation requires starter cells taken from actual animals. <sup>15</sup> Because of this, they emphasize that cell-cultured meat isn’t completely cruelty-free. <sup>16</sup> There’s truth to this. <sup>17</sup> Fetal bovine serum (FBS), extracted from unborn cow fetuses after the mother is slaughtered is used by many companies at the forefront of cell-cultured meat experimentation. <sup>18</sup> For the chicken, cells are extracted from the muscle and fertilized eggs of actual chickens.\r
                <br><sup>19</sup> The cell-cultured meat industry that currently uses FBS is still vastly kinder to animals than traditional livestock production and slaughter. <sup>20</sup> While FBS is harvested from slaughtered animals, extraction from the muscle or a fertilized egg is analogous to a biopsy done on humans\r
            </p>\r
            <br>Furthermore, according to the company’s website, its process of establishing a cell line from a biopsy can produce enough meat “for years — if not decades — to come, reducing the need to take additional cell samples from animals.”\r
            <br><br>Given that cell-cultured meat at scale could reduce the number of animals confined and slaughtered from billions each year to just a fraction of that, there’s an ethical imperative to make the switch.\r
            <br><br>Still, others argue that in order to improve human health, people need to cut back on meat altogether and eat more whole, plant-based foods. These health-conscious critics point out that the average American ate about 225 pounds of meat in 2021 — the highest in recorded history. Plus, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, only 1 in 10 Americans get the recommended amount of fruits and vegetables in their diet.\r
            <br><br>It’s true that people would reduce their risk of diet-related illnesses like heart disease, certain types of cancers, diabetes and obesity if they switched from eating bacon and wings to apples and kale. The reality, however, is that people don’t want to. Public health authorities have been advising citizens for decades to cut back on meat and to eat more fruits, vegetables, whole grains and legumes. I even founded a nonprofit organization, Reducetarian Foundation, with exactly that goal in mind.  \r
            <br><br>But I’ve accepted that taste preferences, habits and cultural traditions are nearly impossible to overcome. If they weren’t, and consumers made purely rational food choices based on health, salads would be the classic American dish — not burgers. Given that there are other public health benefits to ending factory farming, like reducing air and water pollution as well as antibiotic resistance and zoonotic disease — health advocates should do no harm by supporting cell-cultured meat.\r
            <br><br>And with time, cell-cultured meat may become nutritionally superior to meat from slaughtered animals anyway. As a group of scientists noted in a 2022 paper, “Control over cell biology… allows for the fine tuning of nutritional properties to improve human health, where muscle and fat cells can be engineered to produce vital nutrients such as anti-oxidative carotenoids that would otherwise not be found (or only at low concentrations) in conventional meat.”\r
            <br><br>As with any new technology, the trajectory of cell-cultured meat is likely to face a number of obstacles. But at the end of the day, many of the critiques are weak, illogical or just naive. No, cell-cultured meat, as we currently know it, isn’t perfect. But since it could save billions of animals from suffering and even improve public health, it’s well worth a shot.\r
